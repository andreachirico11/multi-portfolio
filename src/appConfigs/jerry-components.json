        "content": " In 2016, he graduated cum laude with a thesis on Kaleidophone and Thesaurus at the Conservatorio of Alessandria. Driven by a strong passion for the natural world, in 2018, he earned a degree cum laude in biology, focusing on the ecological impact of allochthonous species. In 2020, he completed his two-year program at the Conservatory of Piacenza with his work Cross-Rhythms. These works form the basis for the development of his artistic research, leading him to win a scholarship for AReMus, a second-level Post-Graduate Master’s program held in the Conservatory Santa Cecilia in Rome in 2022. In 2023, he was selected for the PhD program in artistic research at the Conservatory Santa Cecilia and University of RomaTre."
